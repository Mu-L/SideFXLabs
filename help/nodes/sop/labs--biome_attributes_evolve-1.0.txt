= Labs Biome Attributes Evolve (Alpha) =

"""Evolve all the attributes on the terrain to create more realistic results."""

Algorithms, noise, and Houdini’s Heightfield Mask by Feature tools evolve our attributes (e.g., temperature, precipitation, and soil) and generate micro-biomes. This attribute evolution allows the plant distribution to be coherent with the topography of the terrain. Parameters are exposed to control this process so artists can achieve the vision they have for their unique environment.

@parameters

== Visualize ==

Display:
    #id: display
    <p>__Input__: The terrain `mask` input in the node.</p>
    <p>__Temperature__: A remapped preview of the `temperature` attribute on the terrain.</p>

    <p>__Soil__: A preview of the `soil` attribute on the terrain.</p>
    <p>__Biome Color__: A preview of the `color` attribute on the terrain.</p>

Auto Remap:
    #id: autoremap
    <p>__Use Real-World Range__: Show a remapped preview of the __Display__ following real-world preset values.</p>
    <p>__Auto Normalize Range__: Show a normalized preview of the __Display__ following the minimum and maximum volume values.</p>
    <p>__Manual Range__: Show a remapped preview of the __Display__ following __Min__ and __Max__ values.</p>

=== AUTOREMAP ===

Compute Range:
    #id: computerange
    Click to fill in the __Min__ and __Max__ parameters with the current minimum and maximum values in the input layer.

Min:
    #id: inputmin
    The lowest value in the input to map from.

Max:
    #id: inputmax
    The highest value in the input to map from.

== Parameters ==

=== Temperature ===

=== Elevation ===

Evolve with Elevation:
    #id: evolvetemp
    Enables the evolution of temperature depending on the elevation.

Lapse Rate:
    #id: lapserate
    The rate of temperature decrease with height. Measured in °C/km. If the value is positive, temperature decreases as height increases. If the value is negative, temperature increases as height increases. 

=== Diffusion ===

Blur between Regions:
    #id: evolvetempxz
    Enables the blurring of temperature between different regions.

Blur Iterations:
    #id: tempsiter
    Higher values will result in a smoother gradient, but will take longer to calculate.

=== Precipitation ===

=== Topography ===

Remove by Convexity:
    #id: removebyocclusion
    Remove mask based on nearby obstructed terrain areas.

Removal Amount over Convexity:
    #id: occlusionramp
    Modify this ramp to use a custom remapping. 

=== Rain Shadow ===

Remove by Direction:
    #id: removebydir
    Remove mask based on the “horizontal” direction the terrain surface faces at a given point.

Rain XZ Direction:
    #id: startxz
    Start direction vector of Rain Shadow. This could be the location of the ocean that is causing the rain shadow. 

Rotate Direction:
    #id: goalangle
    Offset rotation of __Rain XZ Direction__.

Falloff Angle:
    #id: anglespread
    Amount of falloff allowed around the rain shadow.

Removal Amount over Falloff  Angle:
    #id: anglefallofframp
    Modify this ramp to use a custom remapping of __Falloff Angle__.


=== Soil ===

=== Cliffs ===

Remove by Slope:
    #id: removebyslope
    Remove mask based on the slope of the terrain.

Min Slope Angle:
    #id: minslopeangle
    Add areas with a slope greater than or equal to this value to the mask.

Max Slope Angle:
    #id: maxslopeangle
    Add areas with a slope less than or equal to this value to the mask.

Removal Amount over Slope Angle:
    #id: sloperamp
    Controls the value of the mask over the range from the __Min Slope Angle__ to the __Max Slope Angle__

=== Mask ===

Enable Mask:
    #id: enablemask
    Use custom mask for soil.

Mask Layer:
    #id: soilmaskname
    The name of the custom mask to use.

Combine with Noise:
    #id: layermode
    How to composite the mask with the __Soil Noise__ mask. If __Remove by Noise__ is disabled, this value is disabled.

Blend Mask:
    #id: blend
    The amount to blend the custom mask with the soil mask, when __Combine with Noise__ is “blend”. A value of 0 uses the soil mask, a value of 1 uses the custom mask, a value of 0.5 blends equally between the two masks.

=== Soil Noise ===

Remove by Noise:
    #id: removebynoise
    Remove mask based on a noise.

Constant Value:
    #id: basesoil
    The base or minimum value of the soil mask.

Intensity:
    #intensity
    The intensity of the noise. Lower values fade the noise away.

Invert Noise:
    #id: input
    Reverse the noise mask values. 

Amplitude:
    #id: amp
    Scales the intensity of the noise mask.

Element Size:
    #id: elementsize
    Scales the noise pattern outward across the grid.

Noise Type:
    #id: basis
    The type of noise to generate, Different algorithms generate patterns with different characteristics.

Fractal:
    #id: fractal
    
    Whether to do multiple iterations of smaller noise on top of bigger noise.

    None

    Does not add any additional noise on top of the basic noise.

    Standard

    Adds pseudo-random noise on top of the basic output.

    Terrain

    Adds noise like “standard” but dampens the noise in the valleys, which generates more realistic-looking terrain.

    Hybrid Terrain

    Like terrain, but with more sharpness in the valleys.

Max Octaves:
    #id: oct
    Limits the fractal noise to a certain number of iterations.

Lacunarity:
    #id: lac
    The frequency increment between iterations of fractal noise is added to the basic output. Note you can use negative values.


Roughness:
    #id: rough
    Fractal roughness. The roughness parameter determines the coarseness of the noise.
